### Overview:

- Written and programmed in R.
- Data processing and cleaning.
- Creating an application using R's plotly and shinyapps.

### Background:

The instructions for this project were as follows. “First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.”

My project is about the Covid-19 pandemic. As we approach a year and a half since the disease began to impact societies greatly all over the world, using maps created in plotly, I aim to provide a means for comparison between Covid-19 deaths in 2020 and in 2021. The user of my application will be able to see things such as which countries may have been largely unaffected by the initial outbreak but suffered from a huge relative increase in deaths as the virus spread further and wider. There will be 3 maps; the total number of deaths up until August 24th 2020, the total number of deaths up until August 24th 2021, and the percentage growth in deaths from August 24th 2020 to August 24th 2021.
